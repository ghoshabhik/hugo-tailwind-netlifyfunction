                        For the last 13 plus years, I have been part of a software service-based company and during this
                        tenure I have played multiple roles within the orgaization with varied level of
                        responsibilities. Most recently, I'm part of the Solution Architect team, primarily focusing on
                        Data Solution Architecting and Design. I look after accounts migrating their data solution to
                        the cloud and modernizing their leagcy data platforms.

                        Its not so long ago I started with long run. The
                        city has its effect on me, I guess. At work, I met many of my collegues and friends, who are
                        pro
                        marathon runners. I was so inspired looking at their passion towards running that I decided to
                        give it a
                        try. I did run before but not with the goal of loving to run. I'm still building on my
                        techniques but
                        I love the fact that I enjoy running. Specially runnning early in the morning has a calming
                        effect throughout the day. I have participated in several half marathons in Mumbai, India.
                        Hoping to
                        get qualified for my first 42.6KM in next TMM and then someday in the future - NYC marathon üôÇ.
                    </p>
                    <p>So thats runnning, but I find a great deal of happiness with photography too. I feel, photography
                        is
                        an emotional expression of an individual. You see more intensive red colors after drinking
                        coffee - thats
                        science but you cannot see colors like Eliot Porter(who by the way, known to be the first man in
                        american arts to shoot color photos in 1938 ), so thats art. To me, photography is a way to
                        reflect yourself. Its so amazing, so liberating. During my stay in Seattle, WA, I met so many
                        passionate photographers - by the dark lake at midnight waiting for the glimpse of our milky way
                        galaxy, lugging huge weight on the way up to mountain in search for a perfect landscape shot,
                        ignoring snow, ice, rain to see the city when it rains. Ansel Adam, Michael Malford and there
                        are many more who inspired the world to create art through photography. I dont know, whether I
                        create art or snapshots. But I love my photography.üôÇ
