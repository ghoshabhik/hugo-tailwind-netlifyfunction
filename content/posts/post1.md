There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
Heroku’s free cloud services begins with the apps - apps which can be deployed to dynos - our lightweight Linux containers that are at the heart of the Heroku platform. When you sign up with Heroku, you automatically get a pool of free dyno hours to use for your apps. When your app runs, it consumes dyno hours. When it idles (automatically, after 30 minutes of inactivity), or when you scale it down, your app will stop consuming dyno hours.

You can deploy your free app as many times as you need to, (we love continuous deployment practices), and as long as you have dyno hours, your app will be live and publicly accessible.

Get 1000 free dyno hours by verifying your Heroku account with a credit card; unverified accounts receive 550 free hours. You will not be charged, unless you decide to use a paid service. Account verification provides other benefits too, including running more than 5 free apps, as well as free custom domain names.
